    We will be creating a dashboard page with multiple visualizations from our dataset. Visualizations 
    will be created with both Plotly and Leaflet and will include:
        -Cluster group map visualization (total attacks over the period) (LEAFLET)
        -Animated heatmap comparing number of attacks through time (LEAFLET)
        -bar chart comparing number of attacks/region (W/ interactive date info included) (PLOTLY)
        -line chart comparing total number of attacks over time (PLOTLY)
